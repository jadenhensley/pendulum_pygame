# What is it?
* Simulation of pendulum
* Is a nice tech demo, in which gravity gradually increases, and you get to see the pendulum animate
* Features interactivity: user can modify pendulum's length

# Usage
```python ./pendulum.py```

# What I learned
* trigonometry in pygame using the math module
* basics of making a physics simulation
* converting math formulas and pseudo code from different language/library.
